description: >
  T0-managed TASKBOARD-driven development workflow with orchestrator, architect, reviewer, and executor roles.
  This skill should be used when starting a multi-terminal collaborative development session.
  Invoke with role argument such as /taskboard-dev T0, /taskboard-dev T1, /taskboard-dev T2, or /taskboard-dev T3.
  Uses filename-as-status pattern for zero-content polling, tiered code review, and version
  experience management on spec revision. No shared index file, no locks, no parsing overhead.
  v4.3 adds T0 as the user-facing orchestration layer that manages T1/T2/T3 until
  the user's goal is complete or an explicit stop gate is hit.

# TASKBOARD-Driven Development v4.3

T0-managed collaborative development. The user gives T0 one goal, and T0 manages the T1 architect/scheduler, T2 reviewer/verifier, and T3 executor loops until the goal is complete or a stop gate is hit. Status is still encoded in filenames. Polling still uses Glob with zero file content reads. The read-only context layer remains the cross-session memory. v4.3 keeps the same task file protocol as v4.2, but moves day-to-day role management from the user to T0.

## Five Principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Dispatch surface reads filenames only.** Queue discovery via glob, status change via rename, priority via status/depends/mtime/wave. Never poll file content.
2. **Context layer is read-only reference.** PROJECT.md / MAP.md / REQUIREMENTS.md / STATE.md are written by T1, read at defined moments by T2/T3. They never participate in rename or glob queues.
3. **Task file is the only execution unit.** Only `TASK-xxx...md` files get worked on, reviewed, and handed off. Context files are the stable foundation; task files are the moving pieces.
4. **Recovery info is snapshot-on-pause, not always-on.** HANDOFF.md is written only when user explicitly pauses. No per-task sidecar files.
5. **Designed for 5–20 task scale.** No phase layer in v4. REQUIREMENTS.md is a flat list with priority and REQ-ID. Evaluate phase layer only when a milestone grows beyond this range.

### Multi-Agent Patterns Adopted

- **Manager/Worker**: T0 is the manager and user-facing control plane. T1/T2/T3 are workers with bounded roles. T0 assigns, resumes, and monitors work; it does not design, review, or implement inside the same role context.
- **Blackboard**: `docs/taskboard/TASK-*.md` filenames are the shared coordination board. Agents do not depend on private chat history or direct agent-to-agent conversation for handoff.
- **Independent Critic**: T2 remains independent from T0 and T3. T0 can request review, but T0 must not approve its own orchestration decisions as T2, and T3 must not review its own implementation.
- **Liveness / Heartbeat**: T0 watches queue mtime, role idleness, HANDOFF state, and repeated verify failures. Stalled work is recovered by re-issuing the relevant role target or escalating a true stop gate.
- **Stop-Gate Aggregation**: T1/T2/T3 can detect stop gates, but T0 is the only routine user-facing aggregator. Users see product/destructive/credential/repeated-failure/scope questions, not routine role handoffs.

## Invocation

```
/taskboard-dev T0    # User-facing Orchestrator
/taskboard-dev T1    # Architect + Scheduler
/taskboard-dev T2    # Reviewer + Verifier
/taskboard-dev T3    # Executor (code + compile + commit)
```

### Goal-First Invocation (recommended)

For modern Claude Code / Codex runs, start each role with an explicit **目标 / target** before invoking the skill. The target is the durable instruction the loop should pursue across `/taskboard-next`, tool calls, resumes, and context refreshes.

Use this shape:

```text
目标: <role-specific outcome>. Continue autonomously until the target is complete or a stop gate is hit.
停止门: product decision / destructive shared-state operation / credential-payment-privacy risk / repeated verify failure / scope expansion.
执行: /taskboard-dev T{0|1|2|3}
```

Default role targets:

```text
目标(T0): Own the user's goal, initialize or resume the TASKBOARD, launch or instruct T1/T2/T3 as needed, monitor queues and stop gates, recover stalled roles, and keep running until the goal is complete.
执行: /taskboard-dev T0

目标(T1): Maintain PROJECT/MAP/REQUIREMENTS/STATE, create and revise TASK files, resolve safe design choices autonomously, and keep the milestone moving until no unblocked T1 work remains.
执行: /taskboard-dev T1

目标(T2): Continuously review all pending designs and code, run necessary verification, approve/archive passing tasks, and route failures to T3 or stop gates to T1.
执行: /taskboard-dev T2

目标(T3): Complete every unblocked T3 task within its Files/Acceptance scope, run Verify, fix failures within retry budget, commit verified work, and hand off to T2.
执行: /taskboard-dev T3
```

If the CLI provides a dedicated goal/target flag or command, put the `目标` text there. If not, paste it immediately before `/taskboard-dev T{0|1|2|3}` in the session.

> **Model hint**: T0/T1/T2 benefit from the strongest/deepest reasoning model available. T3 can use a faster coding-oriented model once the task is well specified. For long autonomous runs, prefer models/CLI modes that support background execution, resumable sessions, tool-use checkpoints, and explicit goals/targets.

## Autonomy Model

Default stance: **autonomous unless a stop gate is hit**. Earlier versions required the user to manually confirm many handoffs because loop/goal tooling was limited. v4.3 assumes Claude Code and Codex can run long tasks, loop on commands, pursue an explicit target, and let T0 manage routine T1/T2/T3 handoffs. Do not ask for confirmation for routine work.

### Human Approval Required Only For Stop Gates

Stop and surface a concise decision request only when one of these gates is hit:

1. **Product decision**: requirements conflict, acceptance criteria are ambiguous, or the user must choose between materially different product behaviors.
2. **Destructive/shared-state operation**: force push, hard reset, deleting directories, irreversible DB operations, production deploy, or hardware flashing that wipes state.
3. **Credential/payment/privacy risk**: new secrets, paid services, external data sharing, or handling sensitive user data beyond the approved goal.
4. **Repeated failure**: the same verify item fails after the configured retry budget and no safe local fix remains.
5. **Scope expansion**: satisfying the task would require work outside the accepted requirement/task boundary.

### Autonomous Without Asking

Agents SHOULD proceed without asking for:

- Creating/updating task files, specs, plans, STATE entries, history, and review reports.
- Renaming task files through normal status transitions.
- Running builds, tests, linters, formatters, type checks, and read-only verification.
- Applying code changes that are inside the current task's Files/Acceptance scope.
- Committing verified work on the current branch.
- Retrying failed commands within the task retry budget.
- Restarting or resuming a long-running loop when the current goal and task are unambiguous.

### Long-Run Goal Contract

At session start, the user defines a goal/target in plain language for T0. T0 owns that goal and turns it into durable T1/T2/T3 targets. The active goal should be reflected in `PROJECT.md`/`REQUIREMENTS.md` for milestone goals, in the current `TASK-xxx` file for task-level goals, and in each role session's goal/target instruction when the CLI supports one. If a T1/T2/T3 session has no explicit target, it MUST synthesize one from T0's current goal and the current milestone before entering autonomous loop mode; ask the user only when T0 cannot determine the product goal or a true stop gate is hit.

## Initialization (All Roles)

1. Check if `docs/taskboard/` directory exists
2. If not, create directory structure and context file stubs (see below)
3. Check git status for uncommitted changes (crash recovery)
4. Read context files: PROJECT.md, MAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md
5. Read HANDOFF.md if it exists (recovery scenario)
6. Glob `docs/taskboard/TASK-*.T*.md` to display current task summary (excludes history/)
7. Detect available long-run capabilities: loop command, goal/target mode, background task support, resume/session restore, review/planning tools, and sandbox/approval policy.
8. Set run mode: `autonomous` by default; `supervised` only if the user explicitly requests step-by-step confirmation.
9. Set up T0 orchestration loop or role-specific polling/goal-driven loop.
10. **Silently re-read own role's "Boundaries" subsection** (see Role Boundary Enforcement below). Do NOT echo the rules to the user — just internalize them for this session.
11. Confirm once: "T{N} {role} ready. Run mode: {autonomous/supervised}. Review mode: {full/standard/assisted/manual}. Active tasks: {count}. Stop gates: product/destructive/credential/repeated-failure/scope." For T0, confirm: "T0 orchestrator ready. User goal: {goal}. Managed roles: T1/T2/T3. Stop gates: product/destructive/credential/repeated-failure/scope."

### Auto-Generated Directory Structure

```
docs/
  taskboard/              # Active task files (filename = status)
    archive/              # Completed/aborted tasks
    history/              # Execution logs per task
  PROJECT.md              # Project goals, constraints, tech stack (≤100 lines)
  MAP.md                  # Codebase map, directory roles, known pitfalls (≤100 lines)
  REQUIREMENTS.md         # Current milestone flat requirements (≤100 lines)
  STATE.md                # Live decisions + blockers (≤100 lines, replace not append)
  HANDOFF.md              # Recovery snapshot (only on explicit pause)
  dev-log.md              # Completed task summaries
  codex/                  # Review reports from T2 (legacy path; keep for compatibility)
  reviews/                # Optional modern review reports from agents/tools
  superpowers/            # Legacy/compatible planning artifacts
    specs/                # Design specs from T1
    plans/                # Implementation plans from T1
```

On first run: 4 context file stubs + 1 dev-log.md + 7 empty directories. Task files created on demand. Existing v4.0 boards do not need migration; create `docs/reviews/` lazily when a reviewer wants the modern report path.

> **Git config for Chinese filenames**: Run `git config core.quotepath false` in the repo so that `git status` and `git mv` display Chinese characters correctly instead of octal escapes.

---

## Context Layer (Read-Only Reference)

These files provide stable project knowledge. They do NOT participate in task dispatch.

### PROJECT.md (≤100 lines)

Written by T1 at project start. Updated at milestone boundaries.

Only contains:
- Project goal and non-goals
- Tech stack
- Non-functional constraints
- Success criteria

Does NOT contain: temporary decisions, todos, implementation details.

### MAP.md (≤100 lines)

Written by T1 at project start or via `/taskboard-map-codebase`. Updated after architectural changes.

Only contains:
- Key directory responsibilities
- Build/test commands
- Critical module relationships
- High-risk areas and known pitfalls
- Do-not-touch zones

Does NOT contain: requirements, plans, task status.

### REQUIREMENTS.md (≤100 lines)

Written by T1 at milestone start. Flat list with REQ-ID and priority.

```markdown
# Requirements — Milestone: 智能宠物喂食器 v1

- REQ-001 [P1] HuskyLens 识别到指定 ID 后触发喂食
- REQ-002 [P1] 喂食电机转动 3 秒后自动停止
- REQ-003 [P2] OLED 显示当前识别状态和喂食计数
- REQ-004 [P3] 蜂鸣器在识别成功时短鸣提示
```

Does NOT contain: implementation approach, task breakdown.

### STATE.md (≤100 lines, strict maintenance rules)

Written by T1/T2 when decisions are made or blockers arise.

```markdown
# STATE

## Decisions
- D1. 使用 I2S 而非 PDM，因为 ES7243E 需要 MCLK (TASK-003)
- D2. 单核协作式多任务，K10 双核 FreeRTOS 不可用 (TASK-005)

## Blockers
- B1. HuskyLens V2 到货延迟，TASK-008 暂停
```

**Hard rules:**
1. Decisions capped at 10 entries. When full, T1 must prune: remove entries superseded by newer decisions or no longer relevant.
2. New decision that overrides an old one: **replace** the old entry, do not append.
3. Blockers: delete immediately once resolved.
4. Investigation history, debug logs, failed attempts → go to `history/` or `dev-log.md`, never STATE.md.
5. Self-test before adding: "Will this entry still matter next time someone resumes work?" If no, it doesn't belong here.

### When Each Role Reads Context Files

| Role | Reads context files when... |
|------|----------------------------|
| T1 | Creating/revising a task, updating STATE.md |
| T2 | First review of a task (to check against REQUIREMENTS) |
| T3 | First execution of a task (to understand project landscape) |

Context files are NOT re-read on every poll cycle. Only on first encounter with a new task.

---

## Core Design: Filename as Status

Task status is encoded in the filename. No index file, no shared state file, no locks.

### Filename Format

```
TASK-{NNN}.v{V}.{STATUS}[-{REVIEW_LEVEL}].md
```

Examples:
```
TASK-001.v1.T2-待审核方案.md
TASK-001.v1.T3-待执行.md
TASK-001.v1.T3-待验证.md
TASK-002.v1.T2-待审核代码-L2.md
TASK-001.v1.T3-需修复.md
TASK-001.v1.T1-待决策.md
TASK-001.v2.T2-待审核方案.md
archive/TASK-001.v2.完成.md
archive/TASK-003.v1.中止.md
```

### Active Statuses (7)

| Status | Owner | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `T1-方案需修改` | T1 | T1 can autonomously revise design |
| `T1-待决策` | T1 | Requires user input before proceeding |
| `T2-待审核方案` | T2 | Design review pending |
| `T2-待审核代码-L{N}` | T2 | Code review pending (with review level) |
| `T3-待执行` | T3 | Implementation from Pending steps |
| `T3-待验证` | T3 | Implementation done, running Verify checks |
| `T3-需修复` | T3 | T2 rejected code, fix required |

### Terminal Statuses (2)

| Status | Location | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `完成` | `archive/` | Task successfully completed |
| `中止` | `archive/` | Task aborted with reason documented |

### Status Change = Rename

```bash
# T2 approves spec → T3 executes
mv TASK-001.v1.T2-待审核方案.md  TASK-001.v1.T3-待执行.md

# T3 finishes implementation → T3 verifies
mv TASK-001.v1.T3-待执行.md  TASK-001.v1.T3-待验证.md

# T3 verify passes → commit → T2 reviews code
mv TASK-001.v1.T3-待验证.md  TASK-001.v1.T2-待审核代码-L2.md

# T2 approves code → archive
mv TASK-001.v1.T2-待审核代码-L2.md  archive/TASK-001.v1.完成.md

# T2 rejects design, T1 can fix → revision
mv TASK-001.v1.T2-待审核方案.md  TASK-001.v1.T1-方案需修改.md

# T2 rejects design, needs user decision → escalation
mv TASK-001.v1.T2-待审核方案.md  TASK-001.v1.T1-待决策.md

# T1 revises and bumps version
mv TASK-001.v1.T1-方案需修改.md  TASK-001.v2.T2-待审核方案.md

# Any role confirms task is not viable → abort
mv TASK-001.v1.T3-待执行.md  archive/TASK-001.v1.中止.md
```

### Why This Works

- **Zero-content polling**: Glob only reads filenames, never opens files
- **No shared file**: Each terminal renames different files, no write conflicts
- **No locks needed**: `mv` within the same directory is effectively atomic
- **No parsing**: Status is the filename, not buried inside content

## Status Flow

```
T1 creates → .v1.T2-待审核方案 → T2 reviews design
  ├─ PASS → .v1.T3-待执行 → T3 implements → .v1.T3-待验证 → T3 verifies
  │                                            ├─ verify pass → commit → .v1.T2-待审核代码-L{N} → T2 reviews code
  │                                            │                          ├─ PASS → archive/.v1.完成

  │                                            └─ verify fail → stay in .v1.T3-待验证, fix and retry (≤2 rounds)
  │                                                             if still failing → .v1.T3-待执行 (rethink implementation)
  ├─ REVISION → .v1.T1-方案需修改 → T1 revises → .v2.T2-待审核方案
  ├─ STOP GATE → .v1.T1-待决策 → T1 resolves autonomously if safe, otherwise asks user → .v2.T2-待审核方案
  └─ ABORT → archive/.v1.中止
```

---

## Polling

Each role discovers queues with Glob. T0 scans all active task statuses; T1/T2/T3 scan only their own prefixes:

```
T0: Glob docs/taskboard/TASK-*.T*.md, then choose the next managed role
T1: Glob docs/taskboard/TASK-*.T1-*.md
T2: Glob docs/taskboard/TASK-*.T2-*.md
T3: Glob docs/taskboard/TASK-*.T3-*.md
```

### Long-Running Loop Modes

Use the strongest loop primitive supported by the active client:

1. **T0 goal/target loop (preferred)**: run T0 with the user's goal. T0 keeps selecting and launching/resuming T1/T2/T3 until the goal is complete or a stop gate is hit.
2. **Role goal/target loop**: run a role with an explicit target such as "finish all unblocked T3 tasks and hand them to T2". The agent continues selecting next tasks until the target is complete or a stop gate is hit.
3. **Command loop**: run `/taskboard-next` or `/taskboard-dev T{0|1|2|3}` repeatedly through the client's loop command.
4. **Fixed interval loop**: for clients with interval loops, use a 3-minute interval and a cheap one-line idle return.

Example patterns (adapt names to the active CLI):

```
# Claude Code-style fixed interval with a goal instruction
目标: T0 own the user's goal, manage T1/T2/T3, recover stalled roles, and keep running until all tasks are archived or a stop gate is hit.
/loop 3m /taskboard-dev T0

# Goal/target-style long run
目标: T0 own the user's goal, manage T1/T2/T3, recover stalled roles, and keep running until all tasks are archived or a stop gate is hit.
/taskboard-dev T0
```

Loop behavior:

- **T0 active mode** (any queue or incomplete milestone exists): select the next managed role, launch/resume it with its durable target, re-check progress, and continue.
- **Role active mode** (tasks found for this role): select `/taskboard-next`, execute, verify, transition, and continue.
- **Idle mode** (no tasks found): for interval loops, output a single line `T{N} idle — next check in 3m` and stay in the loop — no tool calls, no context re-reads; in goal/target loops, sleep/yield according to client capability. T0 idles only when all role queues are empty and it is waiting for external progress or user resume.
- **Never auto-exit on an empty queue**: a role MUST NOT suggest leaving `/loop` just because its own queue is currently empty. An empty queue is normal — another role may hand off a task minutes later. The ONLY conditions for suggesting exit are: (1) the user explicitly says stop/pause; (2) the entire project is complete (all tasks archived, dev-log/HANDOFF written, milestone declared done); (3) the session is about to hit its context limit and needs a clean restart.
- **Completion**: when the goal is complete and all queues are empty, summarize completed tasks and stop. Do not require the user to manually exit unless the client itself keeps the interval loop alive.

## File Content: Three-Layer Separation

| Layer | Content | Who Reads | Size |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| **Filename** | Status + version + review level | Glob, zero read | 0 tokens |
| **Main file** | Current instruction + metadata + acceptance/verify | Assigned terminal | ≤60 lines |
| **History file** | Past execution logs, debug notes | Only when needed | Unbounded |

### Main File Template (≤60 lines)

```markdown
# TASK-001: Title

**Spec**: docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md
**Plan**: docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
**Version**: v1
**Reqs**: REQ-001, REQ-002
**Depends**: none
**Wave**: 1
**Review**: L2

## Current Instruction

(What to do right now — kept concise)

## Acceptance (T2 verifies against these)

- [ ] HuskyLens 返回正确 ID
- [ ] 喂食电机转动 3 秒后停止
- [ ] OLED 显示识别状态

## Verify (T3 runs these before handoff)

- [ ] `make build` 编译通过
- [ ] 串口输出 "feeding complete"

## Files

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | src/feeding.c |
| Modify | src/main.c |

## Pending

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
```

**Hard limits:**
- Total main file: ≤60 lines
- Pending: ≤8 steps
- Acceptance: ≤5 items
- Verify: ≤3 items (prefer commands or observable signals)
- If any limit is exceeded, the task must be split.

### History Separation

On each status change, append completed work to `docs/taskboard/history/TASK-NNN.history.md` and clear the "Pending" section in the main file. History files live in a separate `history/` subdirectory so they never match active task Glob patterns (`TASK-*.T*.md`).

---

## Version Experience Management

When T1 revises a spec (version bump v1 → v2), the v1 experience in T3's context is often **valuable** — T3 knows what failed and why.

### T1 Experience Summary (required on version bump)

When T1 bumps a version, the task file must include an experience filter:

```markdown
## v1 Lessons (keep — verified by testing)
- Simplex I2S works for speaker output
- ES7243E needs MCLK before I2C init
- Internal SRAM must stay above 40KB for TLS

## v2 Changes (override v1)
- slot_bit_width: use AUTO not 32BIT (caused silence)
- Volume formula: data[i]*vol*vol/10000 (old formula truncated)

## Current Instruction
(what to do now)
```

### When to Restart T3

Version number in filename (`v1` to `v2`) serves as a **visual indicator** for the user. In most cases, keeping v1 experience is beneficial. Restart T3 only when:
- v2 is a **fundamental redesign** (completely different approach, not iterative fix)
- T3's context window is near capacity
- User observes T3 confusing v1 and v2 details

---

## Fresh Context Rules (T3)

Mechanical rules — no subjective judgment required.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Same TASK-ID, same version, ≤2 consecutive fix rounds | **Keep** context |
| Switching to a different TASK-ID | Continue if context budget is healthy; otherwise compact/summarize and resume autonomously |
| Version bumped (v1 → v2) | Refresh context by re-reading the minimum read set; restart only if the client cannot reliably isolate the old context |

### Minimum Read Set After Restart

1. PROJECT.md
2. MAP.md
3. REQUIREMENTS.md
4. STATE.md
5. Current task file
6. Linked spec
7. Linked plan
8. HANDOFF.md (if resuming from pause)

---

## Review Tiers

T1 pre-assigns review level in the filename (L1/L2/L3). T2 may override if actual scope differs.

| Level | Trigger | Review Method | Token Cost |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------|
| L1 | Only .md files | Manual checklist or docs-review skill | ~3K |
| L2 | 1-2 files, under 100 lines | Primary code review tool (Codex review, review subagent, Claude review, or equivalent) | ~8K |
| L3 | 3+ files OR drivers/memory/security | Dual-pass review: primary code review + specialized skill/subagent/manual checklist | ~20K |

### Skill Fallback

| Available | Review Mode |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary review tool + specialized skill/subagent | full — tiered dual-pass review for L3 |
| Primary review tool only | standard — tool-assisted review for all levels |
| Planning/review skills only | assisted — skill checklist plus manual verification |
| none | manual — T2 reviews with checklist |

---

## Role Boundary Enforcement

Each role has a strict **scope of action**. These boundaries are enforced
**by the agent's own discipline**, not by the permission system — the skill is
global, while client-specific controls such as `.claude/settings.local.json`
(Claude Code) or Codex sandbox/approval settings are project/session-local.
Any agent reading this skill in any role session MUST respect the relevant
"Boundaries" subsection below.

### Why boundaries exist

0. **T0 is not T1/T2/T3**: T0 owns user communication and orchestration, not design authorship, code review, or implementation. It may instruct, resume, and monitor role sessions, but routine work still flows through T1/T2/T3.
1. **T1 ≠ T3**: If T1 silently edits source code, the T2→T3 review workflow is
   bypassed and the audit trail breaks.
2. **T2 ≠ T3**: A reviewer who rewrites the code they're reviewing loses
   independence. Findings belong in reports, not patches.
3. **T3 ≠ T1**: An executor who redesigns the spec mid-implementation creates
   silent scope creep. Design changes belong in `T1-待决策`.

### Universal rules (apply to all roles)

- **NEVER** run `git push --force`, `git push -f`, `git reset --hard`,
  `rm -rf <path>` without explicit user confirmation per invocation. These are stop gates, not routine confirmations.
- **NEVER** skip pre-commit hooks with `--no-verify` unless user explicitly
  requests it.
- **NEVER** bypass another role's turn. If work crosses a boundary, rename
  the task to the appropriate role's status and continue/stop according to the next role's queue and the current long-run goal.
- **NEVER** make the user manage T1/T2/T3 when T0 is active. T0 is responsible for deciding which role needs attention next and for surfacing only true stop gates to the user.

### User Override Protocol

If the user explicitly says "直接改" / "不用审核" / "you handle it" / similar
override language, the current role MAY cross its boundary ONCE for that
specific action. When this happens, the role MUST:

1. **Acknowledge the override** out loud: "User override received — will
   perform <action> directly instead of routing through T<N>."
2. **Limit scope** to exactly what the user authorized — do NOT expand.
3. **Record the exception** in the relevant task history file or
   `HANDOFF.md` session notes, so the audit trail stays visible.

Without an explicit override, stay inside your lane, but do not ask the user to approve routine in-lane operations.

## Role: T0 — User-Facing Orchestrator

### Identity

Own the user's goal from intake to completion. T0 is the only role that should routinely talk to the user. T0 initializes or resumes the board, assigns durable targets to T1/T2/T3, monitors queue health, restarts or nudges idle/stalled role loops, and escalates only true stop gates. T0 does not replace the task file state machine.

T0 is manager-only. It must not directly execute development tasks. Design belongs to T1, review and verification belong to T2, and implementation, local verification, and code commits belong to T3. T0 manages these roles; it does not become them.

### Boundaries (read at session init)

**T0 MAY** (normal work):
- Ask the user for the goal at the start of a milestone, then convert it into durable T1/T2/T3 role targets.
- Create or refresh the initial `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `MAP.md`, and `STATE.md` only when no T1 session exists yet; once T1 is running, route design/context updates to T1.
- Run `/taskboard-progress` and `/taskboard-next` to decide which role needs attention.
- Launch, resume, or instruct T1/T2/T3 sessions using the current client capabilities, including background tasks, native subagents, or separate terminal sessions when available.
- Re-issue the same role target after a crash, context compaction, or idle timeout.
- Write `HANDOFF.md` or a concise orchestration note when pausing, recovering, or reporting a stop gate.
- Surface one concise user question only for product/destructive/credential/repeated-failure/scope stop gates.

**T0 MUST** (normal work):
- Keep the user-facing interface goal-oriented: report progress, blockers, and stop gates; do not ask the user to manually choose T1/T2/T3 routine actions.
- Prefer this execution order when multiple queues are active: unblock T1 stop gates first, then run T2 code review, T2 design review, T3 fixes, T3 verification, T3 execution, and finally T1 planning/revision.
- Treat an empty single-role queue as normal. Continue monitoring until all tasks are archived, no active blockers remain, and the user goal is satisfied.
- Preserve role independence: T1 designs, T2 reviews, T3 implements.
- Record any stop gate decision in `STATE.md` or the relevant task file before resuming role loops.

**T0 MUST NOT** (without user override):
- Directly execute development tasks that belong to T1/T2/T3.
- Write implementation code, commit source changes, or run production deploys.
- Approve its own design work as T2 or implement its own design as T3 in the same role context.
- Archive tasks without T2 approval.
- Hide stop gates by choosing a product behavior, destructive operation, credential/payment/privacy action, repeated-failure resolution, or scope expansion on the user's behalf.
- Create a new parallel state system. T0 observes filenames and role sessions; it does not add `T0-*` task statuses.

### T0 Execution Mode

Default execution mode is **auto-terminal mode**. The user manually opens only the T0 entry terminal. After T0 receives the goal, T0 creates or resumes three managed role terminals named `taskboard-T1`, `taskboard-T2`, and `taskboard-T3`, each running its own `/taskboard-dev T{1|2|3}` target loop.

Each managed role MUST run in a separate terminal session and isolated agent context. T0 must not reuse one role's conversation context as another role's context, because that would contaminate design, review, and implementation responsibilities. Shared state flows only through `docs/taskboard/TASK-*.md` filenames, context files, `history/`, `dev-log.md`, and explicit stop-gate notes.

If the client cannot create terminals, T0 may degrade to native subagents if they provide isolated contexts. If neither managed terminals nor isolated subagents are available, T0 may use inline sequential mode only as a compatibility fallback, and must explicitly enforce the role boundary section before every role switch.

### T0 Terminal Launcher

Use `scripts/taskboard_t0.py` to generate managed role sessions and optional launch commands. T0 may execute these commands when the active client allows terminal/process creation; the user should not manually manage T1/T2/T3.

```bash
python scripts/taskboard_t0.py --goal "<user goal>" --root .
python scripts/taskboard_demo.py --root .taskboard-demo --with-heartbeats
python scripts/taskboard_start.py --goal "<user goal>" --auto
python scripts/taskboard_loop.py --root . --goal "<user goal>" --forever --assignment-lease-seconds 300 --launcher windows-terminal --agent-template 'codex --prompt "{target}"'
python scripts/taskboard_t0.py --goal "<user goal>" --root . --launcher windows-terminal --agent-template 'codex --prompt "{target}"'
python scripts/taskboard_t0.py --goal "<user goal>" --root . --launcher powershell --agent-template 'codex --prompt "{target}"'
python scripts/taskboard_t0.py --goal "<user goal>" --root . --launcher tmux --agent-template 'codex --prompt "{target}"'
```

Launcher rules:

- `scripts/taskboard_start.py` is the one-command T0 entry point. It defaults to `--launcher windows-terminal` and `codex --prompt-file "{target_file}"`; add `--execute-launches --forever` when T0 should actually create/recover managed worker terminals and keep supervising.
- `--launcher windows-terminal` emits `wt` commands for managed `taskboard-T1/T2/T3` tabs.
- `--launcher powershell` emits `Start-Process powershell` commands for separate managed windows.
- `--launcher tmux` emits `tmux new-session/new-window` commands for Unix-like terminals.
- `--agent-template` is the client-specific command T0 runs inside each role terminal. It supports `{role}`, `{title}`, `{command}`, `{target}`, and `{target_file}` placeholders. When a launcher command actually references `{target_file}`, `scripts/taskboard_t0.py` writes the corresponding role target files and returns a `target_files` list; inline `{target}` launchers and dry checks do not write those runtime files.
- If an agent-template references `{target_file}` while target files are disabled, T0 must fail fast with `agent-template references {target_file}`; enable target files, use `--launcher none` for no-write dry checks, or switch the template to `{target}`.
- T0 must inject the generated role target. Users should not write separate T1/T2/T3 prompts.
- The first explicit `--goal` is saved to `.taskboard/t0/goal.json` as `taskboard-t0-goal`, so T0 can resume without asking the user to repeat the same goal. This is T0 control-plane recovery state, not TASKBOARD task state.
- If no launcher is requested, the script emits a dry orchestration plan only.
- The script emits `session_manifest` for T0 recovery and health checks. This is not a new shared state database; it is an output summary of managed sessions, recovery order, sync contract, and check commands. Persistent recovery still belongs in `HANDOFF.md`.
- Use `scripts/taskboard_loop.py` for the actual T0 supervisor loop. It combines session heartbeat probing, queue health, and dispatch into each iteration. Add `--execute-launches` only when T0 should execute generated launcher commands; execute mode runs only missing/stale role recovery commands and must not relaunch healthy roles just because the dispatch plan contains full starter commands. Those commands only launch/recover T1/T2/T3 and must not perform worker tasks in T0.
- When `scripts/taskboard_loop.py` detects a `T1-待决策` / stop-gate TASK, it enters `stop-gate` state and suppresses worker launch, role target writes, and assignment for that gate. T0 asks the summarized question through T0 only, then resumes T1/T2/T3 after the stop gate is answered and recorded.
- The supervisor loop stops after the first `stop-gate` iteration by default, including through `scripts/taskboard_start.py --auto`, so T0 waits for the user answer instead of polling the same gate. Use `--no-stop-on-stop-gate` only for monitoring/debugging.
- Stop-gate loop output includes `decision_command`, pointing to `scripts/taskboard_decide.py` with the selected task. T0 should show or use that command after the user answers instead of asking the user to inspect TASKBOARD filenames.
- Use `scripts/taskboard_start.py --goal "<user goal>" --auto` as the one-command user entry. `--auto` executes T0 manager launch/recovery commands and runs until completion by default. It forwards the same latest snapshot, append-only event log, launch lease, and per-role target behavior as `taskboard_loop.py`, and persists `auto_mode`, `starter_mode`, and `resume_config` into latest snapshot plus event log so `taskboard_progress.py` can confirm recovery is from the one-command automatic entry and rebuild the T0 resume command with the prior launcher/template/lease/interval configuration even if latest snapshot is unavailable. If no explicit or saved goal exists, `--auto` stops after the first `needs-goal` iteration and asks for one T0 goal instead of sleep-looping. For bounded dry verification, use `--auto --iterations 1 --launcher none`.
- If `taskboard_start.py --auto` or direct `taskboard_loop.py` receives Ctrl-C / `KeyboardInterrupt`, it returns 130 and reports `taskboard-t0-interruption`, `state=interrupted`, `resume_command`, and `user_action`. The interruption report is also persisted to `.taskboard/t0/latest.json` and `.taskboard/t0/events.jsonl`, so `taskboard_progress.py` can rebuild the T0 resume command even if terminal output is lost. If the latest snapshot is disabled or missing, progress promotes the latest event `interrupted` state into the user-visible T0 recovery state and still rebuilds the command from event `resume_config`. The resume command restarts T0 with the same launcher/template/lease/interval configuration; the user still does not manage T1/T2/T3 directly.
- Use `--assignment-lease-seconds` to set the runtime lease for acknowledged TASK assignments. If the selected role's assignment heartbeat ages past this lease, T0 reports `lease-expired` and reissues the role target without doing the worker task.
- Use `--launch-lease-seconds` to prevent duplicate managed terminals after a successful T0 launch/recovery command. T0 writes `.taskboard/t0/launches.json` as `taskboard-t0-launch-state`, waits for worker heartbeats while the launch lease is active, and reports suppressed launches without asking the user to manage T1/T2/T3.
- If an executed launcher command fails, loop actions report `T0 launch/recovery failed` and tell the user to fix T0 launcher configuration or retry another launcher; do not ask the user to manage T1/T2/T3 directly. Stop launching further worker commands after the first launcher failure in the loop iteration.
- Each loop iteration writes isolated per-role target files to `.taskboard/targets/taskboard-T1.md`, `.taskboard/targets/taskboard-T2.md`, and `.taskboard/targets/taskboard-T3.md` by default. These files are runtime inboxes from T0 to each worker role; they are not task state or shared memory. Each generated target includes a `Role runtime contract` with `assigned_role`, `managed_by: T0`, a "do not execute other role responsibilities" rule, and a "do not rely on another role's chat context" rule so inline prompts and `{target_file}` launches preserve the same role isolation. Each target also includes a `Worker loop contract`: continue cycling that role until no unblocked work remains, refresh heartbeat at every cycle, re-read TASKBOARD filenames and stable docs, and do not stop after one action when more role work is available. Use `--target-dir <path>` to choose another directory, or `--no-target-files` for no-write dry checks. Do not combine `--no-target-files` with a launching template that needs `{target_file}`; use inline `{target}` if worker launches must run without target files.
- Each loop iteration writes the latest T0 supervisor runtime snapshot to `.taskboard/t0/latest.json` by default. This `taskboard-t0-supervisor-state` file is only T0's recovery view and includes `resume_config` for T0 restart command reconstruction; it is not task state or shared memory and must not replace TASKBOARD filenames, history, dev-log, HANDOFF, or the completion sentinel. Use `--state-file <path>` to choose another path, or `--no-state-file` for no-write dry checks.
- Each loop iteration appends a compact event to `.taskboard/t0/events.jsonl` by default. This `taskboard-t0-supervisor-event` log is append-only audit/recovery evidence for T0 dispatch, queue, session, assignment, action summaries, `assignment_role`, `assignment_task`, `assignment_reason`, `assignment_expected_id`, `launch_failure_count`, compact `launch_failures` command/returncode/output details, `resume_config`, `suppressed_launch_count`, `executed_command_count`, stop-gate count, completion readiness, `completion_missing_evidence`, `completion_user_action`, and starter `auto_mode` / `starter_mode` across runs. The assignment fields explain which managed worker target T0 was waiting to acknowledge or reissue. The launch failure and resume fields explain the latest T0 control-plane recovery path when `latest.json` is unavailable. The completion fields explain why T0 kept waking T1 after a completion sentinel instead of summarizing completion to the user; they are not TASKBOARD state or worker memory. Use `--event-log-file <path>` to choose another path, or `--no-event-log` for no-write dry checks.
- T0 stops only when the active TASK queue is empty, `docs/STATE.md` contains `**Goal Complete**: yes` or `Goal Complete: yes`, and the completion audit is `complete-ready`. Empty queue without that completion sentinel means the goal is still incomplete and T0 should wake T1 to create or revise TASK files. If the sentinel exists but archive/dev-log evidence is missing, T0 reports `completion-audit-missing-evidence` and continues waking T1 to record or revise the missing completion evidence. `--forever` runs until completion or interruption; `--no-stop-on-complete` is only for post-completion monitoring/debugging.
- Use `scripts/taskboard_demo.py --root .taskboard-demo --with-heartbeats` to create a reproducible dry-run TASKBOARD that proves T0 loop scheduling without modifying product code. The demo refuses to overwrite an existing `docs/` unless `--force` is passed.

Use `scripts/taskboard_health.py` when T0 needs a deterministic queue and liveness report before waking a role:

```bash
python scripts/taskboard_health.py --root . --stale-minutes 30
```

The health report includes active queue counts, stalled TASK files, the next role/task selected by T0 priority, and manager-only wake/recover actions. It does not authorize T0 to do design, review, implementation, verification, or commit work.
Pass `--goal "<user goal>"` when T0 has received a user goal that has not yet been written to `PROJECT.md`; empty queues plus an explicit goal should wake T1 to create or revise TASK files.

Use `scripts/taskboard_progress.py --root .` for a concise user-facing T0 progress summary. It reports the goal, T0 state, next managed role, current task, assignment state, whether user action is required, text `assignment_role` / `assignment_task` / `assignment_reason` / `assignment_expected_id` / `queue_metrics_active_count` / `queue_metrics_stalled_count` / `queue_metrics_role_counts` / `queue_metrics_next_role` / `t0_supervisor_state` / `t0_supervisor_age_seconds` / `t0_supervisor_stale_after_seconds` / `event_count` / `latest_event_state` / `latest_event_dispatch_state` / `latest_event_next_role` / `latest_event_task` / `latest_event_assignment_state` / `latest_event_assignment_role` / `latest_event_assignment_task` / `latest_event_assignment_reason` / `latest_event_assignment_expected_id` / `latest_event_launch_failure_count` / `latest_event_launch_failure_command` / `latest_event_launch_failure_returncode` / `latest_event_launch_failure_output` / `latest_event_completion_ready` / `completion_ready` / `completion_audit_state` / `completion_missing_evidence` / `resume_command` lines, and JSON assignment details plus `queue_metrics` plus latest event plus completion audit plus `t0_supervisor` freshness plus T0 auto-mode resume command for active tasks, stalled tasks, T1/T2/T3 queue counts, the next controlled role, T0 assignment acknowledgement/reissue reason, the last T0 supervisor event, T0 supervisor stale/fresh state, the latest T0 control-plane launch failure clue, and missing completion evidence; it does not ask the user to manage T1/T2/T3. If latest snapshot is stale, progress reports `t0_supervisor_state=stale` and asks the user to resume T0, not manage T1/T2/T3. If latest snapshot is unavailable, progress computes top-level `active_count` and `queue_metrics` from current taskboard live health so the user can still see T1/T2/T3 queue size, promotes latest event `launch_failures` / `launch_failure_count` into the user action so T0 asks for launcher configuration repair instead of worker takeover, promotes latest event `suppressed_launches` / `suppressed_launch_count` into the summary so T0 waits for recent launch leases instead of duplicating worker terminals, promotes latest event `auto_mode`, `starter_mode`, `next_role`, `task`, and `assignment_*` fields into top-level JSON progress so integrations can confirm one-command T0 auto entry and see which worker T0 is managing without inspecting T1/T2/T3, reports top-level `state=stop-gate` with no `resume_command` and a `decision_command` when the current taskboard has a stop gate, reports top-level `state=needs-goal` with no `resume_command` when latest event `dispatch_state=needs-goal`, and reports top-level `state=complete` with no `resume_command` when the current completion audit is ready. When an active TASK assignment is unassigned, pending acknowledgement, or lease-expired, progress reports that T0 will reissue the role target instead of asking the user to manage that worker. When a stop gate is active, progress includes `decision_command` so T0 can record the user's answer and resume T1 without making the user manage TASKBOARD mechanics. When the goal is not complete and no stop gate is active, progress includes `resume_command` to resume T0 auto mode from latest snapshot or latest event `resume_config`, preserving prior launcher/template/lease/interval settings rather than launching worker terminals directly.
If `taskboard_start.py` or direct `taskboard_loop.py` rejects invalid T0 launcher/template options before a supervisor loop result exists, persist `state=config-error`, `kind=taskboard-t0-config-error`, and `error` into latest snapshot and event log. `taskboard_progress.py` must surface that T0 configuration failure and tell the user to fix T0 launcher configuration, not to manage T1/T2/T3 directly.
If the progress summary reports `T0 launch/recovery failed`, treat it as a T0 control-plane launcher/configuration issue. Do not ask the user to take over T1/T2/T3; adjust `--launcher` / `--agent-template` or retry T0 with another launcher.
If the progress summary reports suppressed launches, T0 is intentionally waiting for recent role launches to heartbeat instead of opening duplicate terminals.

Use `scripts/taskboard_stopgates.py --root .` to aggregate true stop gates for the user. This is a read-only T0 control-plane report: it extracts Gate, Question, Options, and Recommended fields from T1 decision / stop-gate tasks, then asks the user one summarized question through T0 only. It must not execute design, review, implementation, verification, commit, or release work.

Use `scripts/taskboard_decide.py --root . --decision "<user answer>"` after the user answers T0's stop-gate question. This is a T0 control-plane resume action: it records the user answer in the task and `STATE.md`, renames the task from `T1-待决策` to `T1-方案需修改`, and lets T1 revise the plan or task. T0 must not transform the answer into a design, review, implementation, verification, commit, or release.

Use `scripts/taskboard_completion.py --root .` before T0 summarizes completion. This is a read-only evidence audit over active TASK files, archived TASK files, `STATE.md` completion sentinel, and `dev-log.md`. T0 may report the evidence and missing evidence, but must not archive tasks, run worker verification, commit, release, or execute T1/T2/T3 work from this audit.
When completion evidence is missing, `scripts/taskboard_progress.py` should report `No user action required; T0 will wake T1 to record or revise missing completion evidence.` as the user action. This keeps completion evidence repair inside T0-managed role orchestration instead of asking the user to inspect or manage T1/T2/T3.

Use `scripts/taskboard_sessions.py` for managed role liveness. Each T1/T2/T3 role should write a heartbeat at loop start and after each TASKBOARD handoff:

```bash
python scripts/taskboard_sessions.py --root . heartbeat --role T1
python scripts/taskboard_sessions.py --root . heartbeat --role T2 --task TASK-003.v1.T2-review.md --assignment-id T2:TASK-003.v1.T2-review.md
python scripts/taskboard_sessions.py --root . probe --stale-seconds 300 --goal "<user goal>"
```

Heartbeat files live under `.taskboard/sessions/` and are runtime liveness signals only. When T0 dispatches a concrete TASK file, the managed role should include `--task` and `--assignment-id` in its heartbeat so T0 can distinguish pending assignment acknowledgement from active work. These assignment fields are not task state, not shared role memory, and not a replacement for TASKBOARD filenames, `history/`, `dev-log.md`, or `HANDOFF.md`.
When `probe` generates missing/stale role recovery commands, its `--agent-template` supports `{target_file}` and defaults that path to `.taskboard/targets/taskboard-T*.md`, matching the supervisor loop's per-role target files.

### Multi-Agent Synchronization

Use blackboard synchronization, not chat-context synchronization:

- **Task state**: active work is synchronized by `docs/taskboard/TASK-*.md` filenames. A rename is the handoff.
- **Durable context**: milestone-level facts live in `PROJECT.md`, `MAP.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, and `STATE.md`.
- **Execution history**: role work and state transitions are appended to `docs/taskboard/history/TASK-NNN.history.md` and `dev-log.md`.
- **Pause/resume**: cross-session recovery information lives in `HANDOFF.md`.
- **Role isolation**: T1/T2/T3 do not share private conversation history. A role may read the task file and stable context files, but must not inherit another role's hidden reasoning or chat transcript.
- **T0 scheduling**: T0 reads filenames, mtime, history, and stop-gate notes to decide which managed role terminal to nudge or recover next.

### T0 Scheduling Logic

T0 schedules by event priority, not by arbitrary rotation:

1. Keep `taskboard-T1`, `taskboard-T2`, and `taskboard-T3` alive or recoverable.
2. Treat active task filenames as the event queue.
3. Resolve stop gates and review queues before starting more implementation.
4. Prioritize code review over design review, because completed implementation is waiting for acceptance.
5. Prioritize T3 fix/verify work over fresh T3 execution, because it closes existing delivery loops.
6. Use T1 when a decision, plan revision, or new batch of task creation is needed.
7. Do not exit only because one role queue is empty; role idleness is normal in a multi-role pipeline.

### T0 Operating Loop

1. Capture or restate the user goal.
2. Initialize `docs/taskboard/` if missing.
3. Build the orchestration plan with `python scripts/taskboard_t0.py --goal "<user goal>" --root .`.
4. Run `python scripts/taskboard_loop.py --root . --goal "<user goal>" --forever ...` as the T0 supervisor loop, creating or recovering managed role terminals when launch execution is enabled.
5. Run `/taskboard-progress`.
6. If there is no active milestone context, T1 creates or refreshes PROJECT/MAP/REQUIREMENTS/STATE and initial tasks.
7. If queues exist, select the currently highest-priority role using **T0 next** below and nudge/resume that role with its durable target.
8. After each role handoff, run `/taskboard-progress` again.
9. If a role is idle but the milestone is incomplete, keep its managed terminal alive for future handoffs or re-run it after the configured loop interval.
10. Continue until all tasks are archived, `dev-log.md` is current, `HANDOFF.md` is saved if pausing, and the user's goal is satisfied.

### T0 Liveness / Heartbeat Rules

T0 uses lightweight filesystem signals, not a new database:

- Run `python scripts/taskboard_health.py --root . --stale-minutes 30` to inspect active queues, stalled TASK files, next role, and wake/recovery actions.
- Run `python scripts/taskboard_sessions.py --root . probe --stale-seconds 300 --goal "<user goal>"` to detect missing or stale managed role loops before reissuing targets.
- **Healthy**: a role reports progress, a task file mtime changes, a task status advances, or `dev-log.md` receives a completion entry.
- **Idle**: a role queue is empty while other queues still have work. T0 keeps the role available and checks again after the loop interval.
- **Stalled**: a task file mtime is older than 30 minutes while the user's goal is incomplete. T0 runs `/taskboard-progress`, then re-issues the durable target for the owning role.
- **Repeated failure**: the same Verify item fails beyond retry budget. T0 routes the task to T1/T2 for diagnosis and surfaces a user question only if the failure is a true stop gate.
- **Recovery**: after crash, context compaction, or client restart, T0 reads `HANDOFF.md`, checks `git status`, scans all active task filenames, and resumes the highest-priority role from **T0 next**.

### T0 User Output Contract

T0 should report:
- current goal
- active queue summary
- role currently being run or resumed
- completed task count
- stop gate question if needed

T0 should not report routine internal handoffs unless they affect the user's goal, timeline, or required decision.

## Role: T1 — Architect + Scheduler

### Identity

Design solutions, write tasks, maintain context layer, monitor progress. Never write implementation code or review code.

### Boundaries (read at session init)

**T1 MAY** (normal work):
- Write / edit under `docs/**` — specs, plans, task files, STATE, HANDOFF, dev-log, checklists, PROJECT.md, MAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md
- Write / edit auto-memory files when supported by the active client (for example `~/.claude/projects/**/memory/**` or Codex skill memory paths)
- Rename task files for state transitions (`mv` / `git mv` within `docs/taskboard/`)
- Run **read-only** git: `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `branch`, `tag` (list)
- Read ANY file in the project (source included — reading is not writing)
- Invoke available planning skills/tools (for example `superpowers:brainstorming`, `superpowers:writing-plans`, Codex skills, or manual planning)
- Commit DOC-ONLY changes (specs, plans, task renames) — show diff first, use conventional commit style

**T1 MUST NOT** (without user override):
- Write or edit source code (`main/**`, `src/**`, `lib/**`, application code)
- Write or edit build config (`sdkconfig*`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`)
- Run builds (`idf.py build`, `make`, `npm run build`, `cargo build`, etc.)
- Run tests, linters, formatters on source
- Run flash / deploy / publish commands
- Force push, reset --hard, rebase published history

**T1 decision when source looks wrong**:
1. Read the file to confirm the issue
2. Write a TASK file with spec + plan pointing at the fix
3. Rename to `T2-待审核方案` and hand off
4. Do NOT fix it yourself, even for "trivial" one-line changes

**Exception**: user override — see "User override protocol" above.

### Task Creation Checklist (blocking)

T1 must fill ALL required fields before setting status to `T2-待审核方案`:

- [ ] Spec link *(required)*
- [ ] Plan link *(required)*
- [ ] Reqs *(recommended — fill when REQUIREMENTS.md exists)*
- [ ] Depends — even if "none" *(required)*
- [ ] Wave *(required)*
- [ ] Acceptance — 1-5 items *(required)*
- [ ] Verify — 1-3 items, prefer commands *(required)*
- [ ] Pending steps — ≤8 *(required)*
- [ ] Files table *(required)*

**If any required field is missing, T1 must not create or rename the task into an active review state.**

### Workflow

1. User describes a requirement
2. Generate spec via an available brainstorming/planning skill (for example `superpowers:brainstorming`) or manual design
3. *(Optional)* Research: investigate implementation approaches, write `docs/superpowers/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` or `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-research.md`
4. Generate plan via an available planning skill (for example `superpowers:writing-plans`) or manual planning
5. Create task file with all checklist fields filled: `docs/taskboard/TASK-NNN.v1.T2-待审核方案.md`
6. On spec revision: bump version, rewrite "Current Instruction" with experience summary (keep/override)
7. Maintain STATE.md: add decisions, prune superseded entries, delete resolved blockers

### Context Layer Maintenance

| File | When to update |
|------|---------------|
| PROJECT.md | Milestone boundaries only |
| MAP.md | After architectural changes, or via `/taskboard-map-codebase` |
| REQUIREMENTS.md | Milestone start, or when requirements change |
| STATE.md | Every significant decision or blocker change |

### Polling

Glob `TASK-*.T1-*.md`. T1 does NOT archive completed tasks (T2 handles archival).

### Reference Code

For low-level problems, T1 may provide reference code snippets marked as `**Reference (T3 must verify):**`.

---

## Role: T2 — Reviewer + Verifier

### Identity

Review designs and code against goals. Verify task outcomes match requirements. Never write code or design solutions.

### Boundaries (read at session init)

**T2 MAY** (normal work):
- Everything T1 MAY do
- Write review reports to `docs/reviews/` (preferred), `docs/codex/` (legacy compatibility), and `docs/taskboard/history/`
- **Run builds for verification**: `idf.py build`, `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `make`, etc. — read-only verification of T3's claims
- Run test suites, linters, formatters (read-only assessment, no source rewriting)
- Read ALL source files (reading is required for code review)
- Use available review agents/skills: Codex review tools, `superpowers:requesting-code-review`, per-language review skills, or manual checklist
- Rename task files across all status transitions T2 owns (see Status Flow)
- Update `dev-log.md` on archive, `STATE.md` on found blockers

**T2 MUST NOT** (without user override):
- Write or edit source code — **findings go in review reports, not patches**
- Create new features or specs — that's T1's job (escalate via `T1-方案需修改` / `T1-待决策`)
- Flash / deploy / publish
- Commit T3's work — only T3 commits code; T2 may commit archive renames and review reports
- Force push, reset --hard, `--no-verify`

**T2 decision when code is broken**:
1. Run the build / tests to confirm the issue (T2 CAN do this — verification is T2's role)
2. Write rejection details in the task's Current Instruction
3. Rename to `T3-需修复` and hand back
4. Do NOT "helpfully" fix even obvious bugs — independence is the point

**T2 independence rule**: a reviewer who edits the code they're reviewing is
no longer reviewing — they're co-authoring. Lose independence, lose the
second pair of eyes.

**Exception**: user override — see "User override protocol" above.

### Design Review Process

1. Glob `TASK-*.T2-待审核方案*.md`
2. Read task file + linked spec/plan
3. Check against REQUIREMENTS.md (do Acceptance items cover the REQs?)
4. Decision:
   - **PASS** → rename to `T3-待执行`
   - **REVISION** (T1 can fix autonomously) → rename to `T1-方案需修改`
   - **ESCALATION** (needs user decision) → write Decision Needed into Current Instruction, then rename to `T1-待决策`
   - **ABORT** (task not viable) → rename to `archive/中止`, document reason

### Code Review Process

1. Glob `TASK-*.T2-待审核代码*.md`
2. Read main file for scope and file list
3. Review level from filename (L1/L2/L3), may override
4. Execute review per tier

#### T2 Verification Checklist (required for L2/L3)

```
- [ ] Code changes match Acceptance criteria item by item
- [ ] All Plan key steps completed — no scope reduction
- [ ] No "surface fix only, root cause unaddressed" patterns
- [ ] Risk areas from MAP.md properly handled
- [ ] Decision needed? (if yes → T1-待决策)
```

5. Decision:
   - **PASS** → rename to `archive/完成`, move history file to `archive/`, append summary to `dev-log.md`
   - **REJECT** → rename to `T3-需修复`, write rejection details into Current Instruction
   - **DESIGN FLAW** → rename to `T1-方案需修改` or `T1-待决策`

### Timeout Detection

After each rename (status change), touch the target file to reset its mtime: `touch TASK-NNN.vN.NEW-STATUS.md`. If any task file mtime is older than 15 minutes, warn user. After 30 minutes, alert.

## Role: T3 — Executor

### Identity

Implement code, run builds, verify, commit. Never design or review.

### Boundaries (read at session init)

**T3 MAY** (normal work):
- Everything T2 MAY do
- Write / edit source code: `main/**`, `src/**`, `lib/**`, application and test code
- Write / edit build config: `sdkconfig*`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`
- Run builds: `idf.py build`, `make`, `npm run build`, `cargo build`, etc.
- Run tests, linters, formatters with WRITE intent (auto-fix mode OK)
- Flash / deploy / publish for verification — **when the plan explicitly requires hardware verification**
- Commit changes (conventional format, show diff before commit)
- Normal `git push` to feature branches
- Mark Pending checklist items complete in task file
- Rename task files: `T3-待执行` → `T3-待验证` → `T2-待审核代码-L{N}`, and `T3-需修复` → `T3-待验证`

**T3 MUST NOT** (without user override):
- Redesign the spec or plan mid-implementation — if scope needs to change, STOP and rename to `T1-待决策` with a decision-needed note
- Skip the Verify section — every task MUST pass its own Verify items before handoff to T2
- Skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`) unless user explicitly requests it
- Force push (`--force`, `-f`) any branch, ever
- `git reset --hard` without user confirmation per invocation
- `rm -rf` a directory without user confirmation per invocation
- Directly archive tasks — that's T2's job (`T2-待审核代码` → `archive/完成`)
- Run destructive DB operations (`DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, mass `DELETE`) without user confirmation

**T3 decision when the plan is wrong**:
1. Stop implementing
2. Document the discrepancy in the task's Current Instruction
3. Rename to `T1-待决策`
4. Do NOT "patch around" the spec mismatch — that creates silent drift

**T3 destructive-op rule**: destructive/shared-state operations are stop gates. Normal commits, local builds, local tests, formatting, non-destructive migrations in a disposable test database, and task-file renames are routine autonomous actions. Force push, hard reset, mass delete, production deploy, paid-service changes, and flash operations that wipe persistent state MUST be surfaced to the user BEFORE execution with a one-line summary.

**Exception**: user override — see "User override protocol" above.

### Process

1. Glob `TASK-*.T3-*.md`
2. Check version (stale context detection — see Fresh Context Rules)
3. Read main file (≤60 lines)
4. Read spec/plan via links (first execution only)
5. Read PROJECT.md, MAP.md (first execution only)

#### For T3-待执行:

6. Implement each Pending item, mark `[x]` immediately after completion
7. When all Pending items done → rename to `T3-待验证`

#### For T3-待验证:

8. Execute each Verify item
9. If all pass → **commit** (see Commit Convention), then rename to `T2-待审核代码-L{N}`
10. If verify fails → stay in `T3-待验证`, fix the issue, retry verify
    - If still failing after 2 retry rounds → rename back to `T3-待执行` with updated Current Instruction explaining what needs rethinking
11. Append completed work to history file on every status change

#### For T3-需修复:

12. Read T2's rejection details in Current Instruction
13. Fix issues, mark items complete
14. Rename to `T3-待验证` (re-verify before returning to T2)

### Commit Convention

```
git commit -m "{type}(TASK-NNN): {description}"
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Rules:
- Default: 1 task = 1 primary commit
- Fix rounds: allowed as fixup commits
- Timing: commit after Verify passes, before rename to `T2-待审核代码`

### Stale Context Rule

If task version in filename is higher than the version this session has processed, output `[STALE CONTEXT]`, re-read the Minimum Read Set, summarize what changed, and continue autonomously. Pause only if the new version creates a stop gate or the client cannot safely refresh context.

## Commands

### /taskboard-progress

Scans filenames and mtime. Fixed output format:

```
=== TASKBOARD STATUS ===
Milestone: (from PROJECT.md)
Active: {N} tasks | Archived: {N} tasks

T1 queue: TASK-005.v1.T1-待决策
T2 queue: TASK-008.v1.T2-待审核代码-L2
T3 queue: TASK-009.v1.T3-待执行, TASK-010.v1.T3-待验证

⚠ TASK-007 stuck 22min (T3-需修复)
Last completed: TASK-006 — 舵机控制模块 (12min ago)
```

### /taskboard-next

Deterministic selection rules. No model discretion. In autonomous long-run mode, T0 repeatedly chooses which managed role to run next, while T1/T2/T3 repeatedly execute `/taskboard-next` until their queue is empty, the goal is complete, or a stop gate is hit.

Local smoke-test equivalent:

```bash
python scripts/taskboard_next.py --role T0 --root .
```

**T0 next** (priority order):
1. Any `T1-待决策` stop gate (surface to user only if T1 cannot resolve safely)
2. `T2-待审核代码-L{N}` (delivery is waiting for review)
3. `T2-待审核方案` (unblocks implementation)
4. `T3-需修复` (review rejected code)
5. `T3-待验证` (closer to review handoff)
6. `T3-待执行`
7. `T1-方案需修改`
8. No active tasks but milestone incomplete → run T1 to create/revise tasks
9. All tasks archived and goal satisfied → "T0 complete"

**T1 next** (priority order):
1. `T1-待决策` (needs user, surface first)
2. `T1-方案需修改` (can act autonomously)
3. Empty → "T1 idle"

**T2 next** (priority order):
1. `T2-待审核代码-L{N}` (closer to delivery)
2. `T2-待审核方案`
3. Empty → "T2 idle"

**T3 next** (priority order):
1. `T3-需修复` (T2 is waiting)
2. `T3-待验证` (closer to handoff)
3. `T3-待执行`
4. Empty → "T3 idle"

**Within same status, tiebreaker order:**
1. Lower Wave number first
2. Depends satisfied first (skip tasks whose dependencies aren't in `archive/完成`)
3. Earlier mtime first

### /taskboard-map-codebase

T1 analyzes existing codebase and generates/updates `MAP.md`:
- Scan directory structure
- Identify tech stack, build commands, test commands
- Note high-risk areas and known pitfalls
- Document code style conventions
- Mark do-not-touch zones

### /taskboard-pause

Writes `docs/HANDOFF.md` with current state snapshot. Triggered by user request, context compaction/restart, client shutdown, or a stop gate that cannot be resolved locally. Long-running agents should write HANDOFF before yielding if active work remains.

```markdown
# Handoff — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

## Milestone
(from PROJECT.md)

## Active Tasks
| Task | Status | Last Step Completed | Next Step |
|------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| TASK-003 | T3-待验证 | Verify 1/2 passed | Retry verify item 2 |
| TASK-004 | T2-待审核代码-L2 | — | T2 review |

## Dirty Git State
(uncommitted changes: yes/no, which files)

## Blockers
- TASK-008: waiting for HuskyLens V2

## Resume Order
1. T1: read STATE.md, check T1-待决策 queue
2. T3: resume/refresh context, read HANDOFF.md, continue TASK-003
3. T2: review TASK-004
```

HANDOFF.md is always overwritten (latest snapshot only), never appended.

---

## Crash Recovery

On initialization:

1. `git status` — detect uncommitted changes
2. If dirty changes match the active T3 task scope, continue autonomously and verify before commit
3. If dirty changes are outside any active task or imply destructive rollback, treat as a stop gate and ask the user
4. Check for HANDOFF.md — if exists, display resume order and continue according to the current role/goal
5. Glob for stale task files (no change in 30+ minutes): warn in the summary, then continue if unblocked
